This grew my love of data and dataframes and really focused my problem solving skills as i was always looking for answer to questions.</p> I eventually found my way to CodeNation where i got the opputunity to focus on learning software development instead of data science. I pushed myself constantly and went further down the software development rabbit hole and now here we are.</p>"
